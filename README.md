This project is about creating a new data type in C++ to store integers that have digits more than 20 and can't fit in long long int datatype.We stored the numbers as form of characters in the C++ strings and perform operations on BigInt like multiplication of two big integers , calculating fibronacci upto 1000 and checking which big integer is larger etc.
